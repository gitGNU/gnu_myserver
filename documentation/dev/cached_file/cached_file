The CachedFile class was developed to boost access to a file keeping its image
in the primary memory and don't access the disk every time.  A cached file can
be accessed in read-only mode.
To create a cached file a factory object has to be used, CachedFileFactory will
create our cached file instance.  CachedFile uses the flyweight design
pattern, while static data is keep in another class (CachedFileBuffer),
CachedFile keeps a pointer to it plus other volatile data as the current file
pointer, that is different for each access to this file.
If for any reason a CachedFile can't be created then a normal File will be
created and used in the same way.
