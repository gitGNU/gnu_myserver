<h1 class="title">VIEWING YOUR WEB SITE</h1>
<br />
Once you have your web pages saved in the correct directory you will want to view 
them both on the machine they are saved on and over the Internet. <br />
<br />
To view your files on the local machine type:<br />
<br />
<span class="code">http://localhost</span><br />
<br />
in your web browser's address window.<br />
<br />
To view your files over the Internet, you can type your computer's IP
address in any web browser. For example if your IP address is 36.65.34.32 your 
files can be found at:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://36.65.34.32/"><span class="code">http://36.65.34.32</span></a><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">.</span>
 <br />

<h2 class="title">Using a DNS name</h2>

If you would prefer<span class="code">
http://william.homeip.net</span> instead of your IP address you must get a 
DNS name.<br />

<br />
      A DNS name is a network mechanism to assign an IP address a mnemonic name 
      such as <a href="http://www.google.com/"
 target="_blank">www.google.com</a>. You can get a DNS name using a free system 
      like <a href="http://www.DynDNS.org" target="_blank">DynDNS.org</a>. This 
      service is for PC s with always-on (ADSL, cable,...) connections that can 
      be accessed for the better portion of the day.<br />
      <br>
      If you do not have a static IP address, your address changes every time 
      you connect to Internet. But, with a DNS name from DynDNS.org you are accessible 
      whether your IP address is dynamic or static.<br />
      <br />
      To be sure that your new DNS name refers to your machine every time you 
      connect to the Internet, you must also install a dynamic DNS client. You 
      can get a free DNS client at: <a
 href="http://www.directupdate.net/" target="_blank">http://www.directupdate.net</a>.<br />
<br />
If you don&#8217;t like the name <a href="http://myname.homeip.net/"target="_blank">http://myName.homeip.net</a>
but would rather have a name such as <a href="http://www.myname.net/"target="_blank">http://www.myName.net</a>
you need to register a domain through a registrar.
