<br />
WinCGI is a method for writing CGI scripts in Visual Basic. It's not a
"web standard", as it will work only on servers running in Windows
environment.<br />
<br />
To enable WinCGI in MyServer, you need to configure the correct <a href="mimetypes.html" class="code" rel="external">MIME Type</a> corresponding to your
WinCGI
application files, and make them run as WinCGI (<span class="code">EXECUTEWINCGI</span>)<br />
<br />
After configuring your MIME Typer properly, all you need to do to run
your WinCGI application, is to use the script as
the 'action' of your web form, like in this example:<br />
<p class="code">&lt;FORM METHOD=POST
ACTION=www.myfiles.com/cgi-bin/mywincgi.exe&gt;</p>
With this, MyServer will decode and send the data of your form to the
WinCGI application.<br />
<br />
Like in CGI, you can place all your applications in a <span
 class="code">cgi-bin</span>
directory in the <span class="code">web</span> directory in MyServer
as seen below:<br />
<br />
<br />
<div class="center"><img src="images/myfiles.png" title=""
 alt="Web folder" height="260" width="468" style="border: 1px solid #000000" /><br />
</div>
<div class="center"><small>The cgi-bin folder is directly
beneath the selected web folder.</small><br />
</div>
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, WinCGI applications can be placed anywhere as long as their
location
is indicated in the HTML code.<br />
