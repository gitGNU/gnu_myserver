<h2 >What is a web server? </h2>
<p >A web server is an application to allow users to share documents over internet or a local
network.</p>
<p>To
connect to the web server you need only a browser.</p>
<p>
<img src="images/webserver.png" title="" alt="Many clients connecting to a Web Server" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
<br />
Many clients connecting to one server.

<p>This image shows how various clients can be
connected with your server at the same time. Through the network, the
request arrives at your server. The server prepares a response
and sends it to the client. With the evolution of the internet, the
model server-client is the simplest mode to share information easily,
allowing each user to decide what he or she wants to share with others
users</p>
<h2>How are the files shared?</h2>
<p>At the basic level, the server shares HTML
documents and images. These documents and images are very simple
and static and are the basic files you see when you access a website. 
These files are transferred by a protocol called Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br />
<br />
If dynamic content is needed, for example - to run an e-commerce site,
then different protocols are used for the communication of the web server with an extern process. Some of the protocols are Common Gateway Interface (CGI), ISAPI, FastCGI, WinCGI.<br />
HTTP is not a secure protocol because the trasmitted data is not encrypted, to have a secure trasmission you have to use the protocol HTTPS. See the HTTPS protocol <a href="HTTPS.html">here</a>.
