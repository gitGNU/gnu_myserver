<h1 class="title">WEB SERVER</h1>
<h2 class="title">What is a web server?</h2>
A web server is an application to allow users to share documents over internet or a local
network.
<p>To connect to the web server you need only a browser.</p>
<img src="images/webserver.png" title="" alt="Many clients connecting to a Web Server" class="box" />
<br />
Many clients connecting to one server.

<br />
<br />
This image shows how various clients can be
connected with your server at the same time. Through the network, the
request arrives at your server. The server prepares a response
and sends it to the client. With the evolution of the internet, the
model server-client is the simplest mode to share information easily,
allowing each user to decide what he or she wants to share with other
users.
<br />

<h2 class="title">How are the files shared?</h2>
At the basic level, the server shares HTML
documents and images. These documents and images are very simple
and static and are the basic files you see when you access a website. 
These files are transferred by a protocol called Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP).<br />
<br />
If dynamic content is needed, for example - to run an e-commerce site,
then different protocols are used for the communication of the web server with an extern process. Some of the protocols are Common Gateway Interface (CGI), ISAPI, FastCGI, WinCGI.<br />
HTTP is not a secure protocol because the trasmitted data is not encrypted, to have a secure trasmission you have to use the protocol HTTPS. See the HTTPS protocol <a href="HTTPS.html">here</a>.
<br />
<h2 class="title">Path translation</h2>
Web servers translate the path component of a URI into a local file system resource. 
The URI path specified by the client is relative to the web server's root directory
(<a href="virtualhosts.html">virtual hosts</a>).
For example the client can request a file <span class="code">/mydirectory/myfile</span> 
trough a request like: <br />
<br />
 <span class="code">
GET /mydirectory/myfile HTTP/1.1<br />
Host: www.host.com
</span>
<br />
<br />
The server then will map the file name to the current virtual host root directory. If the root directory is <span class="code">/var/www</span> the returned resource will be <span class="code">/var/www/mydirectory/myfile</span> according to what was specified for that MIME type.
