WinCGI is a method for writing CGI scripts in Visual Basic. It's not a
"web standard", as it will work only on servers running in Windows
environment.<br>
<br>
All you'd need to do to run your WinCGI script, is to use the script as
the 'action' of your web form, like this:<br>
<br>
<p class="code">&lt;FORM METHOD=POST
ACTION=www.myfiles.com/cgi-bin/mywincgi.exe&gt;</p>
With this, MyServer will decode and send the data of your form to the
WinCGI script.<br>
<br>
Like in CGI, you can place all your scripts in a <span class="code">cgi-bin</span>
directory in the <span class="code">web</span> directory in MyServer
as seen below:<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/myfiles.gif"
 title="" alt="Web folder" height="260" width="468"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><small>The cgi-bin folder is directly
beneath the selected web folder.</small><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
However, WinCGI scripts can be placed anywhere as long as their
location
is indicated in the HTML code.<br>
