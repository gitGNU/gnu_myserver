FastCGI is an extension to CGI, not dependent to the language
used, providing high performance for applications, by not using server
specific APIs. In FastCGI, you won't have a separate proccess for every
script request.<br>
<br>
You can use FastCGI in MyServer, simply by setting the <a
 href="mimetypes.html" class="code">MIME Type</a> for your script
language to run as
FastCGI (set as <font class="code">RUNFASTCGI</font><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"></span>).<br>
<br>
Read the <a class="code" href="php.html">PHP</a> section
on how using PHP+FastCGI.<br>
<br>
Like in CGI, you can place a <span class="code">cgi-bin</span>
directory in the <span class="code">web</span> directory in MyServer
as
seen below, and put all your applications on it:<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/myfiles.gif" title=""
 alt="Web folder" height="260" width="468"><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><small>The cgi-bin folder is directly
beneath the selected web folder.</small><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
However, CGI scripts can be placed anywhere as it is mapped to the web
server through its extension.<br>
