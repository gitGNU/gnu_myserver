<h1 class="title">ISAPI</h1>
ISAPI (Internet Server Application Program Interface) is a protocol
used by Windows based computers to run an application directly from the
Web page instead of having the server process the application as a <a
 href="CGI.html">CGI </a>script.&nbsp; In order to use ISAPI, you must
create a DLL (dynamic link library) that is run as part of the <a href="HTTP.html">HTTP</a>
application. <br>
<br>
The DLL is loaded in to the calling computer's memory when the web page
is opened and remains there until the user closes the web page.&nbsp;
ISAPI is a faster way to process applications as it does not require
any additional action by the Web Server. <br>
<br>
<font class="warning">Warning</font>: If an ISAPI application crashes it may cause the calling application to fail also.<br>
