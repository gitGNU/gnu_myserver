<h1 class="title">MIME TYPES</h1>
<p>You can modify the MIME types used by MyServer by modifing the
file "MIMEtypes.xml" with a text application such as notepad in Windows or
Emacs in Linux. The following is an example of the .xml file:<br />
</p>
<p class="code">&lt;MIMETYPES&gt;<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MIMETYPE&gt;<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;MIMETYPE&gt;<br />
&lt;EXT&gt;htm&lt;/EXT&gt;<br />
&lt;MIME&gt;text/html&lt;/MIME&gt;<br />
&lt;CMD&gt;SEND&lt;/CMD&gt;<br />
&lt;MANAGER&gt;NONE&lt;/MANAGER&gt;<br />
&lt;/MIMETYPE&gt;
</p>
<p><br />
Each block describe a different MIME type. </p>
<span class="code">&lt;EXT&gt;</span> is the type
of file<br />
<br />
<span class="code">&lt;MIME&gt;</span> is the
Mime type.<br />
<br />
<span class="code">&lt;CMD&gt;</span> is the way
to send the file to the client.<br />
<br />
<span class="code">&lt;MANAGER&gt;</span>
describes the <span class="code">&lt;CMD&gt;</span> command.<br />
<br />
<p>The following values for sending the file to the client are
valid in the <span class="code">&lt;MANAGER&gt;</span> section:<br />
</p>
<div class="left">
<ol>
  <li><span class="code">SEND</span>
- Send the file statically as
is. &nbsp;This command is used for files extensions such as .html and
.jpg that don't need any external intervention from the web server.</li>
  <li><span class="code">RUNCGI</span>
- Run the CGI script
indicated in the path. &nbsp;It is used for file extensions such as
.php and .pl that need to be processed before sending any data to the
client.</li>
  <li><span class="code">RUNFASTCGI</span><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"> </span>- Run the Fastcgi script.
&nbsp;This type will need a fastcgi parser downloaded (see the PHP
page).
&nbsp;It is also used for file extensions such as .php and .pl</li>
  <li><span class="code">EXECUTEFASTCGI</span>
- This also runs the
Fastcgi script, but unlike the RUNFASTCGI above, it does not need a
server to run the script, instead it acts as a self server.</li>
  <li><span class="code">RUNMSCGI</span>- Run the MSCGI script. This library is only available for myServer. 
It is used to build fast and efficient CGIs.</li>
  <li><span class="code">EXECUTE </span>-Treat the file as an
executable and send the output to the client.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="code">SENDLINK</span>
- Send the file that is
contained in a link.</li>
  <li><span class="code">EXECUTEWINCGI</span>
- Send the file as a
WinCGI</li>
  <li><span class="code">RUNISAPI</span>
- Run the ISAPI script.
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><span class="code">EXECUTEISAPI</span>
- Runs the ISAPI script
but does not need a server to run. Instead, it acts as a self server.</li>
</ol>
</div>
Most applications are already handled in the .xml file.&nbsp; If you
would like to add a MIME type append the file and use the code as an
example.
