<h1 class="title">WEB SERVER</h1>
<h2 >What is a web server? </h2>
<p >A web server is an application to allow users to share documents over internet or a local
network.</p>
<p>To
connect to the web
server you need only a browser.</p>
<p>

<br>
Many clients connecting to one server.

<p>This image shows how various clients can be
connected with your server at the same time. Through the network, the
request arrives at your server. &nbsp;The server prepares a response
and sends it to the client. With the evolution of the internet, the
model server-client is the simplest mode to share information easily,
allowing each user to decide what he or she wants to share with others
users</p>
<h2>How are the files shared?</h2>
<p>At the basic level, the server shares HTML
documents and images. &nbsp;These documents and images are very simple
and static and are the basic files you see when you access a website.
&nbsp;These files are transferred by a protocol called Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP). &nbsp;<br>
<br>
If dynamic content is needed, for example - to run an ecommerce site,
there are different protocols needed. Some of the protocols are Common Gateway Interface (CGI), ISAPI, fastCGI,
Hypertext Transmission Protocol, Secure (HTTPS). <br>
<br>If files need to be transfered, there is another protocol. File
Transfer Protocol, (FTP) allows the easy transfer of files such as
programs from one computer to another.<br>
<br>
At this time, myServer does not support FTP, SSl (used by the HTTPS
protocol), NSAPI, or dynamic plugins, but these applications are in the
works. Please refer to the <a href="http://myserverweb.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">TODO</a> page to view a 
development plan for myServer.</p>
