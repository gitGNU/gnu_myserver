<h2>What is a web server? </h2>
         
<p align="center">A web server is an  application to allow users to share 
  documents over internet or a local network.<br>
       To connect to the web server you need only a browser.</p>
      <img src="images/webserver.gif" width="394" height="513"

<p align="left"> This image shows how various clients can be connected with
  your  server at the same time. Through the network, the request arrives
at  your server. &nbsp;The server prepares a response and sends it to the
client.  With the evolution of the  internet, the model server-client is
the simplest  mode to share information easily,  allowing each user to decide
what he or  she wants to share with others users</p>
         
<h3 align="center">How are the files shared?</h3>
     At the basic level, the server shares HTML documents and images. &nbsp;These
  documents and images are very simple and static and are the  basic files
 you see when you access a website. &nbsp;These files are transferred by
a  protocol called Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). &nbsp;<br>
     <br>
     If dynamic content is needed, for example - to run an ecommerce site,
 there  are different protocols needed. &nbsp;Some of the protocols are <span
 class="postbody">Common Gateway Interface (CGI), ISAPI, fastCGI, Hypertext
Transmission Protocol, Secure (HTTPS). </span><br>
     If files need to be transfered, there is another protocol. &nbsp;File
 Transfer  Protocol, (FTP) allows the easy transfer of files such as programs
 from one  computer to another.<br>
     <br>
     At this time, myServer does not support FTP, SSl  (used by the HTTPS 
protocol), NSAPI, or dynamic plugins, but these applications are in the works.
