<h1 class="title">PUBLISHING A WEB SITE</h1>
<br />
By default myServer is installed
with a single host accessible from all the IPs of the local machine.
The files included in the dowloaded version of the server are for
demonstration purposes only. In order to share your files with
others you should replace the files in the web directory with your own files.
<br />
<br />
1. Delete the files that are currently in the web folder<br />
2. Add your own files. <br />
Be sure to include a file named <span class="code">"default.html"</span>
as this is the first file people will see when they access the server.<br />
      <img src="../images/myfiles.png" alt="Default web folder" width="468" height="260" /> 
      <br />
The highlighted "web" directory is where you would make your changes
<br />
<br />
If you would like to change the default folder settings or IP settings you must configure 
the <a href="virtualhosts.html">virtual hosts</a>.
