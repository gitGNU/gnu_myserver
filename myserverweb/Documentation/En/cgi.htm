CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is the standard way in which a web
server passes a user's data to an application and then returns
information to the user.&nbsp; CGI depends on scripts often written in
languages such as <a href="php.html">PHP </a>or <a href="perl.html">Perl</a>
to perform the actions that are requested by the user.&nbsp; In order
to access the CGI script, the name of the application is indicated in
the HTML code.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
For example, if you are creating the form, the URL of the script is
indicated in the FORMS tag:<br />
<p class="code"> &lt;FORM METHOD=POST
ACTION=www.myfiles.com/cgi-bin/myprog.pl&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>Note: Any Script Language that can pipe output can be
used, though -
you can have scripts in Shell Script, Python, etc.&nbsp; You just need
to
configure the correct MIME-Types, and your favorite Script Language
will work in MyServer.</p>
In order to keep all of the CGI scripts in one place, you can place a <span
 class="code">cgi-bin</span>
directory in the <span class="code">web</span> directory in MyServer
as seen below:<br />
<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/myfiles.png" title=""
 alt="Web folder" height="260" width="468" style="border: 1px solid #000000" /><br />
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><small>The cgi-bin folder is directly
beneath the selected web folder.</small><br />
</div>
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, CGI scripts can be placed anywhere as long as their location
is indicated in the HTML code.<br />
<br />
CGI scripts require a the server to process the information.&nbsp; An
alternative is to have to use the <a href="ISAPI.html">ISAPI</a>
protocol.<br />
