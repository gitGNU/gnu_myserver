<h1 class="title">VIEWING YOUR WEB SITE</h1>
<br>
Once you have your web pages saved in the correct folder you will want to view them both on the machine
they are saved on and over the Internet. <br>
<br>
To view your files on the local machine type:<br>
<br>
<font class="code">http://localhost</font><br>
<br>
in your web browser's address window.<br>
<br>
To view your files over the internet, you can type your computer's IP
address in any web browser. For example if your IP address is 36.65.34.32 your files can be found at:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://36.65.34.32/"><font class="code">http://36.65.34.32</font></a><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">.</span><br>
<h2>I hate my IP address</h2>
<p>
If you would prefer<font class="code">
http://william.homeip.net</font> instead of your IP address you must get a DNS name.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
A DNS name is a network mechanism to assign an IP address a
mnemonic name such as <a href="http://www.google.com/"
 target="_blank">www.google.com</a>. You can get a DNS name using a free system like <a href="http://www.DynDNS.org" target="_blank">DynDNS.org</a>.
This service is for PC s with always-on (ADSL, cable,...) connections that can be accessed for the better portion of the day.</p>
<p><br>
If you do not have a static IP address, your address changes
every time you connect to internet. But, with a DNS name from
DynDNS.org you are accessible whether your IP address is dynamic
or static.<br>
</p>
<br>
To be sure that your new DNS name refers to your machine every time you
connect to the Internet, you must also install a dynamic DNS
client.&nbsp; You can get a free DNS client at: <a
 href="http://www.sitedevelopers.com/" target="_blank">http://www.sitedevelopers.com</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you don&#8217;t like the name&nbsp; <a href="http://myname.homeip.net/"target="_blank">http://myName.homeip.net</a>
but would rather have a name such as <a href="http://www.myname.net/"target="_blank">http://www.myName.net</a>
you need
to
register a domain through a fee based system.
