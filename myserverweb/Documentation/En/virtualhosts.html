<h1 align="center">VIRTUAL HOSTS</h1>
 In theory, virtual hosts allow users to lodge an infinite number of sites 
on a  single machine. For example http://mypc.net is different from  http://sub.mypc.net. 
To define virtual hosts in myServer open the file virtualhosts.txt in a text 
editor (such as notepad in Windows or Emacs in Linux). In  this file every 
line describes a different virtual host. Every line must end&nbsp; with a
"diesis ("#) character and the final one with two ddiesis ("##).   
<p align="left">An host description line has the form: <font
 color="#ffff00">a;b;c;d;e;f;g;h</font>; </p>
   
<div align="left"><font color="#ffff00">a</font> is a list of the hosts allowed 
to connect to the virtual hosts. <br>
 <font color="#ffff00">b</font> is a list of the local machine IP allowed 
to use the virtual hosts. <br>
 <font color="#ffff00">c </font>is the port used for accepting connections.<br>
 <font color="#ffff00">d </font>is the protocol used by the hosts. <br>
 <font color="#ffff00">e </font>is the web folder.<br>
 <font color="#ffff00">f</font> is the system folder.<br>
 <font color="#ffff00">g</font> is the accesses log file used by the virtual 
   host. <br>
 <font color="#ffff00">h</font> is the errors log file used by the virtual 
host.   </div>
   
<p>&nbsp;</p>
   
<p>If you want to allow every host to use the same virtual host simply put 
0 in  <font color="#ffff00">a</font>, the same thing can be done for the IP
list (<font color="#ffff00">b</font>). MyServer does an orderly search  for
the virtual hosts, starting from the first record. &nbsp;It is searching for
a full matching virtual host to make the&nbsp; connection.  The current line
allow every connection to see the contents of the folder web.  It listens 
on the default HTTP port, saves the accesses log file in logs/myServer.log 
 and the errors log in logs/myServer.err. The folder that contains the system 
files is system. </p>
     
<p><font color="#ffff00">  0;0;80;HTTP;web;system;logs/myServer.log;logs/myServer.err## 
</font></p>
   
<p>The directories are relative to  the MyServer main folder, if you would 
rather use a full path folder,  put the character "|" before the folder name. 
For example the same line with web  folder in c:\web and system in c:\system 
looks like: </p>
   
<p><font color="#ffff00"> 0;0;80;HTTP;|c:\web;|c:\system;logs/myServer.log;logs/myServer.err## 
</font></p>
   
<p><font size="+1"><br>
 </font></p>
 
<p><font size="+1">Configuring for an Intranet</font><br>
 </p>
 
<p>If your machine is connected to internet and to a local intranet, and you
 would like to have two different sites for every zone, you would write the
host  configuration file in a similar way. The following two lines tell MyServer
that all of  the incoming connections to the internet IP 192.168.0.1 use
the first host and all the  incoming connection to the local IP 56.76.46.74 
use the second host. </p>
   
<p><font color="#ffff00">  0;192.168.0.1;80;HTTP;intranetweb;intranetsystem;logs/myServerIntranet.log;logs/myServerIntranet.err# 
 0;56.76.46.74;80;HTTP;internetweb;internetsystem;logs/myServerInternet.log;logs/myServerInternet.err##<br>
 </font></p>
 
<p><font color="#ffff00"> </font></p>
<big><br>
Configuring for multiple virtual host names</big><br>
   
<p>If you would like to use a list of valid  hosts names for a single virtual 
host you could divide the hosts names with a  single comma(","). The same 
mechanism is used for the IPs list. For example: </p>
   
<p><font color="#ffff00">  sub.mypc.net,mypc.net;0;80;HTTP;web;system;logs/myServer.log;logs/myServer.err##
 </font></p>
   
<p>Allow to access the virtual host from both the sub.mypc.net connection
and the mypc.net connection. IPs are not considered in this example.</p>
