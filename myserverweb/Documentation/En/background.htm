<b>MyServer is a powerful web server designed to be easily run on a personal computer by the average computer user. 
It is based on multi-threaded architecture, which makes it extremely scalable and usable in large scale sites as well 
as in small networks. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, CGI, ISAPI, WinCGI and FastCGI protocols.<br />
You can share files in minutes.<br /><br />
MyServer is available for Windows and Unix-like Operating Systems.</b><br />
<p class="center">
MyServer's principal goal is to create a <b>free</b>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>
powerful </b>application to allow anyone to transform his or her
home PC into a web server and share web files easily. As it is
a multithread application that supports multiprocessor machines, it
can also be used professionally.</p>
