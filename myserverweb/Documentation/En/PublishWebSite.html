<p align="center">By default myServer is installed with a single  host accessible
  from all the IPs of the local machine. The files included in the dowloaded
  version of the server are for demonstration purposes only. &nbsp;In order
  to share your files with others you should replace the files in the web
folder  with the your own files. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    First delete the files that are currently in the web folder, then add 
your  files. <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    Be sure to include a file named "default.html" as this is the first file
  people will see when they access the server.<br>
