Use the openSSL package that you can get at http://www.openssl.org. After installing it run the following commands:

openssl genrsa  -out server.key 

and:

openssl req -new -x509 -days 730 -config openssl.cnf   -key server.key -out server.pem 

These commands will create two files server.key and server.pem. Put them in this folder and configure your virtual host file to use these files adding the following lines under the <VHOST> section:
<SSL_PRIVATEKEY>certificates/server.key</SSL_PRIVATEKEY>
<SSL_CERTIFICATE>certificates/server.pem</SSL_CERTIFICATE>
<SSL_PASSWORD></SSL_PASSWORD>
