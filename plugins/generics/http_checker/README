A HTTP checker rule is added trough the main myserver.xml
configuration file, a rule is a python script to execute on every HTTP
request, for example this rule denies any access if the client
used the host localhost:8080 to connect to the server.

This plugin needs the executors/python plugin to be installed too.

	<HTTP_CHECKER_RULE>

from http_checker import get_header
from http_checker import raise_error

if get_header('Host') == "localhost:8080":
	raise_error(401)
