Rules checker plugin.

This plugin is very similar to generics::http_checker; but
differently, this plugin doesn't require a python environment to be
present.
Even if not flexible as generics::http_checker, this plugin is more
secure as it doesn't allow cycles thus no hangs can happen.

This plugin is at a very preliminary status and many features were not
implemented yet.

Each rule follow has the form:
A => B.

If the condition A is verified then the action B is performed.

For example this simple rule denies access to any client that is
specifying "badhost" as the HTTP host:

	<RULES_CHECKER_RULE>
<![CDATA[getHeader("Host") == "badhost" => error("404")]]>
	</RULES_CHECKER_RULE>

The simple language behind this plugins supports other operators:

and   - logical and.
or    - logical or.
not   - logical not.
==    - case sensitive string comparison.
===   -  case insensitive string comparison.

"A" == "a" is false.
"A" === "a" is true.

It is possible to call functions:
getHeader(headerName) - returns the value of the HTTP HeaderName
header.
error(code) - returns the HTTP error page identified by code.
