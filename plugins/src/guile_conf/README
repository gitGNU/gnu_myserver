This plugin enables to use a configuration file written in scheme.

The plugin MUST be specified on the command line, before any
configuration file is loaded:

$ ./myserver  \
  --plugins=guile_conf:../../plugins/bin/guile_conf/guile_conf.so 


It looks for the `configuration' symbol in the `myserver.sch' file.
The configuration looks like:

A node can have an arbitrary number of attributes, and they are
specified as a list of cons cells, the remaining non-cons cells
contain the children of the node or the value.

  (define configuration 
    '(((name . "foo") (bar . "baz")
       ("value1" "value2" "value3" "value4"))
      ((name . "foo") "10")))


it is possible to use Scheme for virtual hosts definitions too:

having these values in the main configuration file:

  ((name . "server.vhost_handler")
   "guile")
  ((name . "server.vhost_location")
   "virtualhosts.sch")


And a new file "virtualhosts.sch" is read, containing for example this
data:

(define vhosts
  '(("example" "8080" "web" "system" "http")))
