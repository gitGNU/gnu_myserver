This is what you need in order to have embedded PHP under myserver:

1) Download the complete PHP source tarball here:
	http://www.php.net/downloads.php

2) Launch the configure script in this way:
	./configure --prefix=/opt/ --enable-embed=shared \
	--enable-maintainer-zts


3) Compile everything executing:
   make && sudo make install

4) Be sure the /opt/lib path is linked by the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   environment variable.
   It is suggested to add /opt/lib in the /etc/ld.so.conf and after
   execute ldconfig.

5) Put the php module directory in your
	 myserver/binaries/external/http_managers directory (you can use a
	 symbolic link too), this is needed only to make possible to use the
	 create_skeleton.pl script.

6) At this point we need to create the Makefile to compile our
   module.  No need to be brave and write it by yourself, the
   create_skeleton.pl script can help you.

7) Et voilà, now you can compile the module, execute the make command
   inside the plugin directory.

8) Copy the obtained php.so file in the external/http_managers

9) Add the following lines to the MIMEtypes.xml file:
	<MIMETYPE>
	<EXT>php</EXT>
	<MIME>text/html</MIME>
	<CMD>php</CMD>
	<MANAGER>NOT_USED</MANAGER>
	</MIMETYPE>


10) Reboot myserver

11) Enjoy it.
