This is what you need in order to have embedded PHP under myserver:

1) Download the complete PHP source tarball here:
	http://www.php.net/downloads.php

2) Launch the configure script in this way:
	./configure --prefix=/opt/ --enable-embed=shared

3) Compile everything executing:
	make && sudo make install

4) Put the php module directory in your
	myserver/binaries/external/http_managers directory (you can use a
	symbolic link too), this is needed only to make possible to use the
	create_skeleton.pl script.

5) At this point we need to create the Makefile to compile our
	module.  No need to be brave and write it by yourself, the
	create_skeleton.pl script can help you.

6) Et voilà, now you can compile the module, execute the make command
	inside the plugin directory.

7) Copy the obtained php.so file in the external/http_managers

8) Add the following lines to the MIMEtypes.xml file:
	<MIMETYPE>
	<EXT>php</EXT>
	<MIME>text/html</MIME>
	<CMD>php</CMD>
	<MANAGER>NOT_USED</MANAGER>
	</MIMETYPE>


9) Reboot myserver

10) Enjoy it.
