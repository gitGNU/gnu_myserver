@c -*-texinfo-*-
Under POSIX it is possible to change the MyServer process user identifier
and group identifier after it has bound the necessary ports (only the
root user can bind ports < 1024).

To specify a different process user id (PID), you must specify it in
the @file{myserver.xml} file as:

@example
<PROCESS_USER_ID>PID</PROCESS_USER_ID>
@end example

Differently, to change the process group id (GID), the configuration
line to use is:

@example
<PROCESS_GROUP_ID>GID</PROCESS_GROUP_ID>
@end example

When one of these features is used, MyServer will not use the
auto-reboot because it will not be possible to get back old
permissions.

@section Fork Server
In a POSIX environment the @code{fork} syscall is used to execute new
processes.  It clones the caller process keeping any open file or
connection in the child process too.  To avoid this problem a fork
server is present in MyServer.
The communication between the MyServer process and the
fork server is done trought a socket.  When MyServer wants to execute
a new process two connections are opened to the fork server, for
the stdin and stdout streams, and the fork server will fork itself and
execute the process using these connections as its I/O streams.

It is not configurable in any configuration file as the MyServer
process is forked to create it before any file or connection is
active.

It is enabled passing the @code{-f} switch to the myserver process.
