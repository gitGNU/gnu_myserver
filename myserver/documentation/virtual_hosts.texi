@c -*-texinfo-*-
Virtual hosts is a method to link more than a domain name to the same
machine, even if they refer to the same network interface.  Virtual
hosts are supported by the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

For example http://mypc.net is different from http://sub.mypc.net.  
Virtual hosts are defined in the file @file{virtualhosts.xml}. 
A sample virtual hosts configuration file looks like:

@example
<VHOSTS>
  <VHOST>
    <NAME>Every connection</NAME>
    <PORT>80</PORT>
    <IP>192.168.0.0/24</IP>
    <PROTOCOL>HTTP</PROTOCOL>
    <DOCROOT>web</DOCROOT>
    <SYSFOLDER>system</SYSFOLDER>
    <HOST>foo.bar.com</HOST>
    <ACCESSLOG>logs/myServer.log</ACCESSLOG>
    <WARNINGLOG>logs/myServer.err</WARNINGLOG>
    <ALLOW_CGI>NO</ALLOW_CGI>
  </VHOST>
</VHOSTS>
@end example

@itemize
@item <NAME>
it gives the server administrator an idea of what the virtual host
is such as internal Ethernet, external ethernet or every connection.
@item <PORT>
it is the port used to accept connections.
@item <IP>
it is optional.  It defines a CIDR subnet mask in the format A.B.C.D/E
or defining the first and the last IP address in the range as
A.B.C.D-E.F.G.H.  Multiple masks can be defined for the same virtual
host.
@item <PROTOCOL>
it is the protocol used by the host.
@item <DOCROOT>
it is the directory where the files are found.
@item <SYSFOLDER>
it is the system directory.
@item <HOST>
it is your virtual host's name. The optional useRegex="YES"
means the address would act as a regular expression, not only a fixed
value.  Multiple host names can be defined for the same virtual host.
@item <ACCESSLOG>
it is the access log used by the virtual host
@item <WARNINGLOG>
it is the errors log file used by the virtual host.
@end itemize

Log files can have extra options:

@example
<ACCESSLOG type="combined">logs/myServerHTTP.log</ACCESSLOG>
@end example

With this option, the logs will have two extra fields: HTTP Referrer
and HTTP User Agent.
Using cycle="yes" you will enable log cycler on the log file. When a
log file with cycling enabled reaches the max size for log files it
will write its content to a new file and recreate the original
file. By default cycled log files uses the gzip compression to save
space, if you don't want to use gzip specify cycle_gzip="no".
Here is an example of a FTP virtual host:

@example
<VHOSTS>
  <VHOST>
    <NAME>Ftp connection</NAME>
    <PORT>21</PORT>
    <IP>127.0.0.1/32</IP>
    <PROTOCOL>FTP</PROTOCOL>
    <DOCROOT>web</DOCROOT>
    <SYSFOLDER>system</SYSFOLDER>
    <HOST>ftp.foo.bar.com</HOST>
    <ACCESSLOG>logs/myServer.log</ACCESSLOG>
    <WARNINGLOG>logs/myServer.err</WARNINGLOG>
  </VHOST>
</VHOSTS>
@end example

Tags semantics are identical with first example.
Although FTP is used for public file sharing, restrictions may be
imposed using security file.

MyServer gives you the option to enable the HTTP TRACE command for
each virtual host. All you need to do is edit the @file{security.xml}
file of the root of your virtual host (not a subdirectory!  If the
file doesn't exist, you may create a new one), and add the parameter:

@example
<HTTP TRACE="ON" />
@end example

Once you do that, you enable HTTP TRACE command. By default, it's
disabled (so, simply delete the line, if you want to disable it)
