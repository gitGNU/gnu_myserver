<h1 class="title">FTP</h1>
FTP (File Transfer Protocol - port 21) is one of the oldest Internet 
protocols still in widespread use. Over the time FTP protocol received 
improvements and additions so it is documented in several RFC documents. 
Basic FTP servers usually implement RFC 959 as a minimum.
FTP runs over TCP and uses 2 channels: one for data(files) exchanged, 
one for controlling data connection. Protocol permits user to decide how 
data transfer is set up: passive - server listens on a random opened data 
port; active - server connects to client opened port to transfer data.
<br />
The objectives of FTP protocol are:
1. To promote sharing of files(computer programs and/or data),
2. To encourage indirect or implicit use of remote computers,
3. To shield users from variations in file storage systems among different hosts,
4. To transfer data reliably and efficiently.
<br />
FTP protocol is a popular choice for file transfer over the Internet.
<h2 class="title">FTP Criticism</h2>
It is possible to abuse built in proxy features telling a server to send data to a 
third computer(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_eXchange_Protocol" target="_blank">FXP</a>)
User names and passwords are sent in clear text. To protect them TSL/SSL cryptographic 
protocols can be used.
Multiple TCP/IP connections are used so is hard to configure firewalls for it.
FTP is a high latency protocol due to the number of commands needed to initiate a file transfer.
No integrity checks are done at receiving site. Maybe used checksums(like for example MD5) to 
check if the file is OK.
Files' time stamp is not preserved after transfer. There is a 
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/drafts/draft-somers-ftp-mfxx/" target="_blank">draft</a> proposing extensions to FTP 
protocol in order to avoid loosing time stamp.
<br />
<h2 class="title">Anonymous FTP</h2> 
It is the common way to distribute public documents/files over the Internet.
This way users interested in published materials do not need an account. 
Modern clients hide login process for anonymous FTP servers providing bogus passwords.
<br />
The default installation of myserver configures a FTP vhost on the
standard port 21, under UNIX-like systems only the root user has the
needed privileges to use that port, be sure you are root before
execute myserver or change the default port.
