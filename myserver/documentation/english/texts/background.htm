<b>MyServer is a powerful web server designed, to be easily run on a
personal computer by the average computer user.<br />  It is based on
multi-threaded architecture, which makes it extremely scalable and
usable in large scale sites, as well as in small networks. It has
built-in supports for the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.  <br /> Support
for dynamic pages is made available trough CGI, ISAPI, WinCGI, SCGI
and FastCGI protocols.  <br /> You can share files in minutes.  <br />
<br /> MyServer is available for Windows and Unix-like Operating
Systems.</b>  <br /><br /> Our principal goal is to create
a <b>free</b> and <b>powerful</b> application, to allow anyone to
transform his or her Personal Computer into a web server and share web
files easily.<br />  MyServer can also be used professionally due its
multi-thread architecture and its multi-processor support.<br /><br />
