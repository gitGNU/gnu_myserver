<h1 class="title">HOW TO USE PERL UNDER MYSERVER</h1>
<br />
Perl is another widely used scripting language perfect for text
manipulation and web database management. Perl also works with
HTML and XML as well as other markup languages. With Perl's
CGI.pm module, included with the standard distribution, HTML
forms are easily handled.<br />
<br />
In order to use Perl, you must first make sure you have an interpreter.<br />
<br />
On UNIX like systems to find out where perl is, use the command:<br />
<p class="code">
type perl</p>
<br />
In order to use Perl in Windows you must first install it.&nbsp; The
interpreter and documentation can be found at the 
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/" target="_blank">Active State Tool Company.</a><br />

<br />
More information and samples of code can be found at The Perl web
site ( <a href="http://www.perl.org" target="_blank">www.perl.org</a>)
or by reading the documentation included with the interpreter. <br />
