<h1 class="title">HOW TO USE PHP UNDER MYSERVER</h1>
<br />
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is the most used server-side scripting
language in the world. A server-side language is used to create web pages with
dynamic content. You can use PHP with MyServer as either a standard CGI
executable or as a FastCGI server. While using PHP like a CGI
executable, MyServer will create a new process for every page
requested. &nbsp;While using PHP in the FastCGI mode, MyServer does not
require a new process for every request and, therefore, the server
performs better. Please refer to the official <a
 href="http://www.fastcgi.com/" target="_blank">FastCGI </a>site for
more information about FastCGI.<br />
<br />
In order to use PHP, you must first download the installer from: <span class="code">
<a href="http://www.php.net" target="_blank">www.php.net</a></span>.
<p>With the last versions of PHP you will also need to modify
the <span class="code">php.ini</span> file to set the
cgi.force_redirect option to null. Find the line in the php
configuration file:</p>
<span  class="code">;cgi.force_redirect= 0</span>
<p>and remove the first semicolon. <br />
The line will then read:<br />
</p>
<span class="code">cgi.force_redirect = 0</span><br /><br />
