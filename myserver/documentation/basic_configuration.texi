@section Configuration files
The MyServer configuration is done using three different XML files:

@itemize
@item @file{myserver.xml}
It contains the main myserver configuration.  Almost all settings here
can be redefined locally for virtual hosts or directories.
@item @file{MIMEtypes.xml}
It contains the default MIME types configuration.  It can be redefined
for any virtual host.
@item @file{virtualhosts.xml}
This file defines the different virtual hosts used by MyServer.
Virtual host here is not used properly, as this file is used to define
sites on a protocol different than HTTP/HTTPS where there are not
virtual hosts, for example FTP.
@end itemize

These files can exist in different locations, they are looked in the
following order:
@enumerate
@item Current working directory.
@item Personal directory, ~/.myserver/.
@item Global scope inside /etc/myserver.
@end enumerate

@section Message localization
It is possible to change the localization for some MyServer messages
changing the @code{server.language} value in the @file{myserver.xml} file.
By default the english language is used, the value specified here must
refer to a xml file contained in the @file{languages/} directory.

@section Server administrator
CGI scripts can get the server administrator e-mail and show them to
the user (through the SERVER_ADMIN environment variable). 
It is defined trought the @code{server.admin} variable, that can be
set in the global configuration file or for virtual host.

@section Temporary files position
There can be need for the server to save temporary files as a form of
inter-process communication.
It is possible to configure the directory where temporary files are
stored trought the @code{server.temp_directory} variable inside the
main configuration file.
Operations on disk are much slower than read or write directly from
the primary memory.  To solve this problem under GNU/Linux you can
think about use virtual memory instead of a persistent storage device
to store files.

It can be done, by the root user, as:

@example
# mount -t tmpfs -o size=256m tmpfs /tmp/tmpfs
@end example

The previous command mount a portion of memory, 256M, on the
/tmp/tmpfs and it can be used as a normal file system.
At this point, @code{server.temp_directory} shall be set to
@file{/tmp/tmpfs} to benefit from it.
Files saved on the primary memory are not persistent between reboots,
introducing another level of security as temporary data will not be
saved on the server.
