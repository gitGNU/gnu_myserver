@section Configuration files
The MyServer configuration is done using three different XML files:

@itemize
@item @file{myserver.xml}
It contains the main myserver configuration.  Almost all settings here
can be redefined locally for virtual hosts or directories.
@item @file{MIMEtypes.xml}
It contains the default MIME types configuration.  It can be redefined
for any virtual host.
@item @file{virtualhosts.xml}
This file defines the different virtual hosts used by MyServer.
Virtual host here is not used properly, as this file is used to define
sites on a protocol different than HTTP/HTTPS where there are not
virtual hosts, for example FTP.
@end itemize

These files can exist in different locations, they are looked in the
following order:
@enumerate
@item Current working directory.
@item Personal directory, ~/.myserver/.
@item Global scope inside /etc/myserver.
@end enumerate

@section Message localization
It is possible to change the localization for some MyServer messages
changing the @code{LANGUAGE} value in the @file{myserver.xml} file.
By default the english language is used, the value specified here must
refer to a xml file contained in the @file{languages/} directory.

@section Server administrator
CGI scripts can get the server administrator e-mail and show them to
the user (through the SERVER_ADMIN environment variable). So, it can
be important you define this address properly, by setting the value in
the line below, in @file{myserver.xml}:

@example
<SERVER_ADMIN>root@@foo.com</SERVER_ADMIN>
@end example
