@c -*-texinfo-*-
It is possible to change almost any configuration for a single
directory or a single resource trough the @file{.security.xml}.
This file can be placed in any web directory and it will overwrite
default configuration values.  If the @file{.security.xml} file is not
found in the directory where the requested resource is, then MyServer
will look in the parents directory until the file is found.
If @file{.security.xml} is not present in the virtual host root
directory then the default one which is present in the system
directory will be used.

Usually consider the first valid value found in this order:
@enumerate
@item Local @file{.security.xml}.
@item Parent directories @file{.security.xml}.
@item System vhost directory @file{.security.xml}.
@item Virtual host configuration.
@item Global server configuration.
@end enumerate

Some values are not configurable in any @file{.security.xml} file and
they are took directly from the Virtual host configuration and in some
cases directly from the global configuration file.

In MyServer there are two different steps involved in the logging
phase: user authentication and validation.

In the first step a permission mask is found given the
username:password pair, no other information are used in this phase.
In the second phase this value is refined using more information.
The two phases are completely separated and it is possible to use
different sources for any of them.

The @file{.security.xml} can be used for both phases and by default it
is.

The anonymous user is matched inside MyServer with the ``Guest''
username and an empty password.

@section Security file user authentication
The information used for the first phase of logging is a simple list
of USER elements.  Any permission is configured by an attribute, if
the attribute value is equal to ``YES'' then the permission is granted.

The permissions that MyServer considers are:
@enumerate
@item READ
@item EXECUTE
@item BROWSE
@item WRITE
@item DELETE
@end enumerate

In the following example we enable an anonymous user to access
resources in READ/EXECUTE/BROWSE mode, DELETE and WRITE are both
denied.

@example
<SECURITY>
  <USER name="Guest" password="" READ="YES" EXECUTE="YES" BROWSE="YES"
     DELETE="NO" WRITE="NO"/>
</SECURITY>
@end example

As no other information beside username:password is used, this first
phase is the same for any protocol supported by MyServer.

@subsection FTP Anonymous user
To allow the @file{.security.xml} re-use, the FTP ``Anonymous'' user
is mapped internally by MyServer to the ``Guest'' user.
