In order to generate a certificate you need the certtool utility
provided by GNU TLS.
Look here for more information: http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/.

certtool --generate-privkey --outfile cert.key
certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey privkey.key --outfile cert.pem

These commands will create two files server.key and server.pem. Put
them in this directory and configure your virtual host file to use these
files adding the following lines under the <VHOST> section:

<SSL_PRIVATEKEY>certificates/cert.key</SSL_PRIVATEKEY>
<SSL_CERTIFICATE>certificates/privkey.pem</SSL_CERTIFICATE>
<SSL_PASSWORD></SSL_PASSWORD>
